## Technologies

* pandas
* tensorflow 
* sklearn
* Google Colab

## Data

This dataset comes from the venture capital firm Alphabet Soup. I then Utilized tensorflow and sklearn to predict whether the businesses were successful.

## Results

First, using OneHotEncoder to transform the categories into numerical data, I split it into training and testing sets and applied StandardScaler to transform. I then tested a neural network to predict the success. I then attempted to optimize the neural network model but found that the original model had the best loss and accuracy.
